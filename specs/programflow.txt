RPG Program Flow

The script entry point is simply at index.php, with an optional feature to use
mod_rewrite. Requests will look something like the following:

::
  http://example.com/rpg/admin:char/edit/32/
  |----- base url -----|     |        |   |
                         controller   |   |
                                  action  |
                                        params

Sub controllers may be used by separating parts with a colon. For example,
the admin:char controller will be in controllers/Admin/Char.php, and be named
AdminCharController. After the controller is the action, which will correspond
to the do{Action} method of the controller. If there is no specified
controller in the URL, it will use IndexController. If there is no action,
it will use the doIndex() method. If a controller or action is not found, the
system will throw an exception.

The index file will start the autoloading mechanism, load the config file,
and route the request to a controller with RPG_Router::processRequest.

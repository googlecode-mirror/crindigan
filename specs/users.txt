==============
Handling Users
==============
This document describes the user login, session, and membership systems,
including integration with the member systems of other software.

---------------
Login Procedure
---------------
The login procedure will basically do the same thing, regardless of the
membership system used. It will take a username and password, pass it to
an authentication class, and verify that the credentials are correct. If
correct, the session will be modified to register that a user is logged in.
If incorrect, the visitor will be redirected back to the login form with an
error, where they can try again.

In the case of integrating with an external software, a user record will be
created upon the first login, containing the user's ID on the external
software for referencing, and other RPG-related columns. Registration options
like username, password, and email will be nulled.

A user will have an option to automatically log in whenever he or she comes
back to the site, by ticking a checkbox on the login form.

-----------------
Username Handling
-----------------
Since the RPG should not be required to be installed on the same database as
an external system, we must avoid joining with user tables throughout the code
As a result, when starting a "new game," the user will be required to enter a
secondary username that will be used within the RPG. It will then be stored
alongside the other information within the local user record. Logging in will
still use the records from the external system.

--------
Sessions
--------
Sessions will be handled by RPG_Session, which also includes a database-backed
save handler so a list of online users and locations can be created.

------------
User Storage
------------
User records will always be stored with the RPG. If using the built-in member
system, the records will have all the registration information filled in, such
as username, password, and email. If using an external system, these fields
will be nulled. The RPG will not need to depend on extra columns in an external
software's user table, with the exception of a "money" or "points" column.

-------------------
User Money Handling
-------------------
For both the builtin and external member systems, money will be stored in the
local user record. If the external system tracks money/points, users will be
able to transfer their earnings between both the RPG and the external software.
Make sure to keep this open for exchange rates, and possibly taxing to put
revenue in another account.

------------
Registration
------------
If using the builtin member system, users will have to go through a basic
registration process. At the end of the process, a user record will be added
to the RPG's database. Future features may include email confirmation,
moderated users, and a CAPTCHA system.

Form Library
============

This document describes the workings of the form library, contained within
the RPG_Form namespace. The form library should facilitate the creation,
validation, and population of form elements. When retrieving values, it should
convert user input


Creation
--------

Form creation will be handled by calling methods on an RPG_Form instance::

	$form = new RPG_Form;
	$t = $form->add('text', array(
	    'name' => 'blah',
	    'size' => 20,
	    'value' => $blah,
	));
	$t->addValidator('regex', '#[A-Za-z0-9]+#');

Some other text.

Validation
----------

The validation portion should take user input from the request, and run each
form element through its set series of validators. If all the validators are
successful, then the program can continue as normal. If not, then the system
will display a message for each validation failure at each of the form
elements, and prompt the user to resubmit the form.

Validators can be specified within the "validators" key of the element options
when adding an element, or can be added via an element's addValidator() method.

Method 1::

	$form->addText(array(
	    'name' => 'blah',
	    'validators' => array(
	    	'regex' => '#^[A-Za-z0-9]+$#',
	    ),
	));

Method 2::

	$text = $form->addText(array('name' => 'blah'));
	$text->addValidator('regex', '#^[A-Za-z0-9]+$#');

Population

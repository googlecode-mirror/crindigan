RPG Inventory Management
========================
This document describes how the inventory system works.

Overview
--------
Unlike the previous version, where items could not be unique, each inventory
record in NG will be separate. The quantity column will be removed from the
inventory table, while adding the creation date and other metadata. Basically,
imagine the records in the item table as classes, and the records in the
inventory table as instances of those classes, including differing properties.

Table: inventory
````````````````
:id:       uint, primary key
:user_id:  uint, the user this belongs to
:party_id: uint, the party this belongs to
:item_id:  uint, the base item id this record is based from
:inventory_metadata: text, various properties like # uses, item health

Crindigan is a browser-based role playing game where battles take place on two side-by-side grids, similar to Suikoden V or Cross Edge. The code is based on a small, custom framework written with the MVC architecture in mind. It will hook into the membership systems of various third-party products, along with a standalone version.

Running the application requires PHP 5.2.3, and MySQL 5.0 (untested in 4.1, but could work).
